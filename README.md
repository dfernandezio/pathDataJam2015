# Ukko

We decided to chose the name of the Finnish God of Weather since we'll be joining whether data with PATH Train turnstile data. Due to the short time window for this project we have limited our scope to:

  - Clean up PATH turnstile data (Credit to Guy Who Cleaned it first)
  - Download and cleanup Weather Data from Weather Underground
  - Load and join data in a PostgreSQL Database
  - Visualize the joined datasets using Google Charts
